### **Welcome to Labyrinth!**

<img src="figure/labyrinth.png" style="width: 40%"/>

This is an open-sourced project for simulating the fantasy text-based adventure game: **Jim Henson's Labyrinth: The Adventure Game**[[1]](#1) grounded on large language models supported by kani[[2]](#2).

The Goblin King, which is the game manager, is built on a large language model and support the players to proceed the game while controlling the game flow and following the game rules.

The game system is a chat-based via the terminal, where the players interact with an AI working as a game manager to explore the enormous world of the Labyrinth, including talking with the NPCs, fighting against the opponents, utilizing the objects and items, and solving the interesting puzzles!

The users can simulate an experience on the terminal that is almost identical to actual gameplay. (Note that however, this is a research-purpose project so it cannot replace the complete in-person game play.)

For the details on the game rules of Labyrinth, you can refer to [the game book](https://www.riverhorsegames.com/products/rh_lab_005). Although this repository includes the player character data, the summarized game rules and the data of each game scene, it does not cover all details and contents of the tutorial book.
