# Evaluation Guideline

### Project summary

This project is for simulating the text-based adventure game, Jim Henson's Labyrinth: The Adventure game, based on the LLM-powered game manager. (a.k.a Goblin King in the game)

Especially, the key of this project is the function calling, which calls a user-defined function when it is needed considering the chat messages and the game states, to perform more fine-grained controls or directly use/update the game states. 

The goal of this project is how much the function calling can improve the performance of the game manager in terms of the management of the game states and game flow.
